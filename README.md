I'm a full-stack software engineer born and raised in Marquette, MI who loves clean, simple, & beautiful design. I also enjoy editing & crafting brand identities. 

When I'm not working, you can find me cooking, doing yoga, rowing on Lake Superior, painting a birthday card, playing board games with friends and family, reading a solarpunk novel in a hammock, canoe camping, or rock climbing around the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
